# Technical Trial

## Introduction

In order to allow us to evaluate your technical knowledge as well as your way of solving problems, we developed a brief challenge.

The challenge is pretty simple and it consists on creating the layout of a responsive landing page that looks good in these three formats:

- Mobile;
- Tablet;
- Desktop;


##  What is a Landing Page?

A landing page is a simple page designed to convince the visitor to convert, which can be the acquisition of a certain product or, in our case, the filling out of a form containing your contact details (Lead).

We have some references to let you know what we expect from your test:

- [Landing Page 1](references/lp-01.png)
- [Landing Page 2](references/lp-02.png)
- [Landing Page 3](references/lp-03.png)
- [Landing Page 4](references/lp-04.png)
- [Landing Page 5](references/lp-05.png)

## About the test

Our business team requested the development of a landing page for the **HealthMax** customer who needs leads for the Health Insurance offered by the company.

### The client provided only two versions of the logo:
* [Version 1](healthmax/logo-color.png)
* [Version 2](healthmax/logo-white.png)

### The form on this page must contain the fields:

#### Step 1:

- Full Name
- Date of Birth
- Email
- Phone Number
- Get Offer Now Â» (Button)

#### Success Message:
- Thanks **FULL NAME** for registering!
Soon we will contact you by **EMAIL** with more information.

##### PS:
- *Replace the "FULL NAME" with the data informed in step 1*;
- *Replace the "EMAIL" with the data informed in step 1*;

**Its mission is to create a responsive Landing page with a beautiful and attractive design for visitors.**

*The texts on the page can be [lorem ipsum](https://lipsum.com/) but if you feel like you can create the texts too.*

## About the code:

We want to see your skills so when creating this landing page we need you to use some programming languages that we use in our day to day. In this case we would like to see how you work with HTML/CSS (SASS) and JavaScript.

You can use a framework like Bootstrap for structure/style. However, we do not use jQuery but if you want to use something similar, we suggest the [Zepto](https://zeptojs.com/) is a minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely jQuery-compatible API.

The form does not have to be functional, but we would gladly see it going from "step 1" to "success message" by JavaScript :)

## Have you finished creating an incredible Landing Page?

You can upload the project to a public repository ([GitHub](https://github.com/)) or send us the project in a ".zip" or link to <thiago.ramos@actualsales.com>.

## Thank you and good luck!
